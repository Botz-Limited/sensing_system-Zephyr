# Build Error Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Forward Declaration Error
**Error**: `'continue_discovery' was not declared in this scope`
**Fix**: Added forward declaration at the top of `ble_d2d_tx.cpp`
```cpp
static void continue_discovery(void);
```

### 2. Undefined Reference Errors

#### a) `fota_proxy_handle_secondary_complete()`
**Error**: Undefined reference when building
**Cause**: FOTA proxy is only compiled for primary device, but D2D RX is compiled for both
**Fix**: Added conditional compilation in `ble_d2d_rx.cpp`:
```cpp
#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG)
extern int fota_proxy_handle_secondary_complete(void);
fota_proxy_handle_secondary_complete();
#endif
```

#### b) `bt_gatt_write_without_response_cb`
**Error**: Multiple undefined references
**Cause**: GATT client functionality not enabled
**Fix**: Added to `prj.conf`:
```
CONFIG_BT_GATT_CLIENT=y
```

## Configuration Changes

### prj.conf
Added GATT client support which enables:
- `bt_gatt_discover()` - For service discovery
- `bt_gatt_write_without_response()` - For sending commands
- Other GATT client operations

### Kconfig
Updated to ensure primary device also selects GATT client:
```
config PRIMARY_DEVICE
    select BT_GATT_CLIENT  # Primary needs GATT client for D2D TX
```

## Why These Were Needed

1. **GATT Client**: The primary device acts as both:
   - GATT Server (for phone connection)
   - GATT Client (for D2D communication with secondary)

2. **Conditional Compilation**: FOTA proxy is primary-only, so calls to it must be protected

3. **Forward Declarations**: C/C++ requires functions to be declared before use

## Build Commands

After these fixes, both configurations should build:
```bash
# Primary device
west build -b <board> -- -DCONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE=y

# Secondary device  
west build -b <board> -- -DCONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE=n
```

## Verification

The build should now complete successfully with:
- No undefined references
- No undeclared function errors
- Both primary and secondary configurations building cleanly
