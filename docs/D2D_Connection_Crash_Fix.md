# D2D Connection Crash Fix Summary

## Problem Description
The primary device was crashing with a kernel panic when the secondary device tried to connect. The crash occurred immediately after "Starting characteristic subscriptions..." in the BT RX workqueue thread.

## Crash Details
```
[00:00:24.657,012] <err> os: esf_dump: Faulting instruction address (r15/pc): 0x000800b2
[00:00:24.657,135] <err> os: z_fatal_error: >>> ZEPHYR FATAL ERROR 4: Kernel panic on CPU 0
[00:00:24.657,165] <err> os: z_fatal_error: Current thread: 0x20006218 (BT RX WQ)
```

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Context Issue**: The subscriptions were being performed directly from the GATT discovery callback, which runs in the BT RX workqueue context. This can cause issues with stack usage and timing.

2. **Connection Reference**: The connection handle wasn't properly reference-counted, which could lead to use-after-free if the connection was dropped during subscription.

3. **Array Bounds**: No validation of the subscription array index before use.

4. **Race Condition**: The secondary_conn pointer was being reassigned during discovery without proper synchronization.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Work Queue for Deferred Subscriptions
Instead of subscribing directly from the discovery callback, subscriptions are now deferred to the system workqueue:

```c
// Work item for deferred subscription
static void subscribe_work_handler(struct k_work *work);
K_WORK_DEFINE(subscribe_work, subscribe_work_handler);

// In discovery callback:
LOG_INF("Scheduling characteristic subscriptions...");
k_work_submit(&subscribe_work);
```

### 2. Added Connection Reference Counting
Properly manage connection lifetime with reference counting:

```c
// When starting discovery:
secondary_conn = bt_conn_ref(conn);

// When disconnecting:
if (secondary_conn) {
    bt_conn_unref(secondary_conn);
    secondary_conn = NULL;
}
```

### 3. Added Array Bounds Checking
```c
if (index < 0 || index >= ARRAY_SIZE(subscribe_params)) {
    LOG_ERR("Invalid subscription index %d", index);
    return;
}
```

### 4. Added Work Cancellation on Disconnect
```c
// Cancel any pending subscription work
k_work_cancel(&subscribe_work);
```

### 5. Fixed Connection Handle Assignment
Removed duplicate assignment of secondary_conn during discovery to prevent reference counting issues.

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Stability**: Subscriptions now run in a proper context with adequate stack space
2. **Safety**: Connection references prevent use-after-free bugs
3. **Robustness**: Bounds checking prevents array overruns
4. **Clean Shutdown**: Work cancellation ensures no pending operations on disconnect

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Connection**: Verify secondary device can connect without crashes
2. **Test Subscriptions**: Ensure all 8 characteristics are successfully subscribed
3. **Test Disconnect/Reconnect**: Verify clean disconnect and reconnection
4. **Test Rapid Connect/Disconnect**: Stress test with rapid connection cycles
5. **Monitor Logs**: Look for successful subscription messages without errors

## Expected Log Output (Success)
