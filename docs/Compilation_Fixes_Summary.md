# Compilation Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing `extern "C"` declarations in ble_services.hpp

**Error**: `jis_total_step_count_notify` was not declared in this scope

**Fix**: Added `extern "C"` to the function declarations in the header file:
```cpp
// Step count notify functions
extern "C" void jis_total_step_count_notify(uint32_t total_steps, uint32_t activity_duration);
extern "C" void jis_activity_step_count_notify(uint32_t activity_steps);
```

### 2. Missing initializer for `fota_progress_msg_t`

**Warning**: missing initializer for member 'fota_progress_msg_t'

**Fix**: Added the missing `is_active` field (bool) to the initializers:
```cpp
// Before:
static fota_progress_msg_t fota_progress_value = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};

// After:
static fota_progress_msg_t fota_progress_value = {false, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
```

The structure has 6 fields:
- `bool is_active`
- `uint8_t status`
- `uint8_t percent_complete`
- `uint32_t bytes_received`
- `uint32_t total_size`
- `int32_t error_code`

### 3. Designator order for `bt_conn_cb` (Already fixed)

The designator order was already fixed in bluetooth.cpp to match the structure definition.

### 4. Duplicate case value (Already fixed)

The duplicate `MSG_TYPE_ACTIVITY_STEP_COUNT` case was already removed.

## Build Status

All compilation errors should now be resolved. The build should complete successfully.
