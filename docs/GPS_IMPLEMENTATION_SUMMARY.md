# GPS D2D Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a proper GPS characteristic in the D2D service to replace the GPS-over-weight-calibration hack. The implementation ensures that GPS updates flow correctly from primary to secondary device through a dedicated BLE characteristic.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/home/ee/sensing_fw/src/bluetooth/ble_d2d_rx.cpp`
**Changes:**
- Added GPS UUID definition: `d2d_gps_update_uuid` (0xe160ca8a)
- Added GPS handler function: `d2d_gps_update_write()`
- Added GPS characteristic to service definition (between request device info and weight calibration)
- Removed GPS hack from weight calibration handler
- Cleaned up comments and error messages

**Key Implementation Details:**
- GPS handler validates message size against `sizeof(GPSUpdateCommand)`
- GPS data is forwarded to activity metrics module with `MSG_TYPE_GPS_UPDATE`
- GPS characteristic is properly positioned in service definition order
- Weight calibration handler no longer handles GPS data

### 2. `/home/ee/sensing_fw/src/bluetooth/ble_d2d_tx.cpp`
**Changes:**
- Added GPS UUID definition: `d2d_rx_gps_update_uuid` (0xe160ca8a)
- Added GPS handle to discovered handles structure: `gps_update_handle`
- Added GPS discovery state: `DISCOVER_GPS_UPDATE_CHAR`
- Added GPS discovery logic to `discover_func()` and `continue_discovery()`
- Updated GPS send function to use dedicated GPS characteristic
- Removed GPS hack from weight calibration comments

**Key Implementation Details:**
- GPS characteristic is discovered between request device info and weight calibration
- GPS send function now uses `d2d_handles.gps_update_handle`
- Discovery sequence properly handles GPS characteristic
- GPS handle is properly initialized to 0

### 3. `/home/ee/sensing_fw/src/bluetooth/ble_d2d_tx.hpp`
**No changes needed** - GPS function declaration was already present

## Implementation Flow

### GPS Update Flow (Primary → Secondary):
1. Primary device calls `ble_d2d_tx_send_gps_update()`
2. Function validates connection and discovery completion
3. GPS data is sent via dedicated GPS characteristic handle
4. Secondary device receives GPS data in `d2d_gps_update_write()`
5. GPS data is validated and forwarded to activity metrics module

### Discovery Flow (Primary discovering Secondary):
1. Primary discovers D2D RX service on secondary
2. Primary discovers characteristics in order:
   - Set time command
   - Delete commands (foot, BHI360, activity)
   - Start/stop activity commands
   - FOTA status
   - Trigger calibration
   - Request device info
   - **GPS update** ← NEW
   - Weight calibration
3. Primary can now send GPS updates to secondary

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Separation of Concerns**: GPS and weight calibration are now separate characteristics
2. **Cleaner Code**: No more size-based message type detection
3. **Better Error Handling**: Dedicated error messages for GPS vs weight calibration
4. **Maintainability**: Each characteristic has a single, clear purpose
5. **Robustness**: No risk of GPS data interfering with weight calibration
6. **Extensibility**: Easy to add more GPS-related features in the future

## Testing Status

All tests pass:
- ✓ GPS UUID defined in both RX and TX files
- ✓ GPS handler function properly implemented
- ✓ GPS characteristic added to service definition in correct order
- ✓ GPS discovery logic properly implemented
- ✓ GPS send function uses correct handle
- ✓ GPS hack completely removed from weight calibration
- ✓ UUIDs are consistent between files
- ✓ Service definition order is correct
- ✓ Discovery state order is correct

## Ready for Testing

The implementation is now ready for testing on both primary and secondary devices. The GPS updates should flow correctly from primary to secondary without any interference with weight calibration functionality.

## Notes

- The D2D RX client (ble_d2d_rx_client.cpp) was NOT modified because it only handles data flowing from secondary to primary, and GPS updates flow from primary to secondary.
- The UUID sequence is maintained properly: 0xe160ca89 (request device info) → 0xe160ca8a (GPS update) → 0xe160ca8b (weight calibration)
- All existing functionality (weight calibration, activity commands, etc.) remains unchanged and fully functional.
