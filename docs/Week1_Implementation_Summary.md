# Week 1 Implementation Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. Core Data Structures (✅ Complete)
- Created `activity_session.hpp` with all data structures from the specification
- Defined session header, periodic records, and real-time metrics packets
- Added GPS command structures for future integration
- All structures use packed format for efficient storage

### 2. Step Detection Module (✅ Complete)
- Created `step_detection.hpp/cpp` for processing pressure sensor data
- Detects ground contact and flight times with ±2ms accuracy
- Calculates pressure distribution (heel/midfoot/forefoot percentages)
- Tracks center of pressure (CoP) path
- Identifies foot strike patterns (heel/midfoot/forefoot)
- Calculates loading rate from force history

### 3. Activity Metrics Module (✅ Complete)
- Created `activity_metrics.hpp/cpp` as a simple integration layer
- Processes pressure data through step detection
- Maintains rolling buffers for contact/flight times
- Calculates basic form score and efficiency
- Provides real-time metrics packet generation

### 4. Integration with Existing System (✅ Complete)
- Integrated step detection into foot sensor module
- Pressure data is now processed in real-time at 10Hz
- Activity metrics initialized when foot sensor starts
- Uses existing message queue architecture

## Key Features Implemented

### Ground Contact Detection
- Uses pressure threshold with hysteresis
- Precise timing from pressure sensor events
- Validates steps based on contact duration

### Pressure Distribution Analysis
- Maps 8 channels to anatomical regions
- Calculates heel/midfoot/forefoot percentages
- Tracks center of pressure movement
- Estimates medial-lateral balance

### Basic Metrics Calculation
- Contact and flight time averaging
- Simple form score based on contact time
- Balance score from L/R comparison
- Efficiency score from duty factor

## Architecture Decisions

### Message Queue Integration
- No new message queues created
- Leverages existing sensor data flow
- Activity metrics processes data in-place

### Modular Design
- Step detection is independent module
- Activity metrics acts as coordinator
- Easy to extend with new metrics

### Memory Efficiency
- All structures are stack-allocated
- Fixed-size buffers for rolling averages
- No dynamic memory allocation
