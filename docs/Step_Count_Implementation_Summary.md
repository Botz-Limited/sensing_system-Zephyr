# Step Count Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the new step counting system that tracks both global and activity-specific step counts, removes time/duration from step count characteristics, and properly logs step data.

## Key Changes

### 1. Step Count Data Structures

#### Original Structure (with duration):
```c
typedef struct {
    uint32_t step_count;
    uint32_t activity_duration_s;  // REMOVED
} bhi360_step_count_t;
```

#### New Implementation:
- **Duration field deprecated**: `activity_duration_s` is now always set to 0
- Time-based metrics should be calculated using separate time characteristics
- Created new header file `app_step_count.hpp` with clean step count structures

### 2. Step Count Tracking

The motion sensor now tracks:
- **Global Step Count**: Total steps since device boot (continuous)
- **Activity Step Count**: Steps during current activity session only

```c
// File-scope variables in motion_sensor.cpp
static uint32_t latest_step_count = 0;          // Global step count from sensor
static uint32_t activity_start_step_count = 0;  // Step count when activity started
static uint32_t latest_activity_step_count = 0; // Steps during current activity
static bool activity_logging_active = false;
```

### 3. BLE Characteristics

#### Existing Characteristics (unchanged):
1. **BHI360 Data2** (UUID: `0c372eb3-...`): Individual foot step count
2. **Total Step Count** (UUID: `0c372ec4-...`): Aggregated steps from both feet

#### New Characteristic:
3. **Activity Step Count** (UUID: `0c372ec5-...`): Steps during current activity only

All characteristics now provide only step count (4 bytes), no duration.

### 4. Activity Session Management

When activity starts:
- Captures current global step count as baseline
- Resets activity step count to 0
- Sets activity logging flag

When activity stops:
- Clears activity logging flag
- Final activity step count = current global count - baseline

### 5. Log File Changes

#### BHI360 Log File:
- Contains global step count in each record
- Tracks continuous step progression

#### Activity Log File:
- Now saves left and right foot counts separately
- Protobuf updated:
```protobuf
message ActivityData {
  uint32 left_step_count = 1;   // Left foot step count
  uint32 right_step_count = 2;  // Right foot step count  
  uint32 delta_ms = 3;          // Time delta
}
```

### 6. Data Flow

```
Motion Sensor (Global Steps) → Message Queue → Bluetooth Module
                                                    ↓
                                            Individual Notify
                                                    ↓
                                            Aggregate & Notify Total
                                                    ↓
                                            Activity Steps Notify

Motion Sensor (Activity Steps) → Message Queue → Bluetooth Module
                                                    ↓
                                            Activity Notify
```

### 7. Benefits

1. **Like a smartwatch**: See daily total steps AND activity-specific steps
2. **Clean separation**: Step counts are pure counts, no time mixing
3. **Flexible metrics**: Phone can calculate pace, cadence, etc. using its own time tracking
4. **Detailed logging**: Activity logs now preserve left/right foot data
5. **Backward compatible**: Existing characteristics still work

### 8. Usage Example

For a running session:
- Before run: Global steps = 5000
- Start activity: Activity steps = 0
- During run: Global = 8000, Activity = 3000
- After run: Global continues counting, Activity stays at final value

### 9. Mobile App Integration

The app can now:
- Display total daily steps (global count)
- Show activity-specific steps
- Calculate pace using GPS distance / activity steps
- Track left vs right foot balance from activity logs
- Calculate step rate using its own timers

## Testing

To verify the implementation:
1. Monitor global step count - should always increase
2. Start an activity - activity count should start at 0
3. Stop activity - activity count should freeze at final value
4. Check BLE characteristics - all should show step count only (duration = 0)
5. Review activity log files - should contain separate left/right counts
