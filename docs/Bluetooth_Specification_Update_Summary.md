# Bluetooth Specification Update Summary

## Overview

The Bluetooth_Specification.md document has been updated to version 1.0 with comprehensive coverage of all BLE services and characteristics implemented in the sensing firmware.

## Major Updates

### 1. Added Missing Characteristics

#### Information Service
- **FOTA Progress** (`0c372eb5-...`): Real-time FOTA update progress with detailed data structure

### 2. New Service Sections Added

#### 7. FOTA Proxy Service
- Complete specification for firmware updates on secondary devices
- All 4 characteristics documented with command/status values
- Usage flow and implementation notes

#### 8. File Proxy Service  
- Complete specification for file access on secondary devices
- Command format, file types, and status values documented
- Usage examples included

#### 9. Device-to-Device (D2D) Services
Three sub-sections added:

##### 9.1 D2D RX Service (Primary Device Only)
- Mirrors Control Service for D2D communication
- 5 characteristics for relaying commands to secondary

##### 9.2 D2D TX Service (Secondary Device Only)
- Mirrors Information Service for D2D communication
- 11 characteristics for sending data to primary

##### 9.3 D2D File Transfer Service
- Runs on both device types with different roles
- Complete protocol specification with packet structure

## Format Consistency

All new sections maintain the existing format:
- Service UUID clearly marked with bold formatting
- Purpose statement for each service
- Detailed characteristic tables with all columns
- Command/status value enumerations
- Usage flows and examples
- Implementation notes

## Technical Details Added

1. **Conditional Compilation Notes**: Clearly indicates which services are primary-only or secondary-only
2. **Data Structures**: Added C struct definitions for complex data types
3. **Protocol Details**: Command formats, packet structures, and flow diagrams
4. **Usage Examples**: Step-by-step instructions for common operations

## D2D Service Documentation

The D2D services are now comprehensively documented with:
- Clear explanation of primary/secondary roles
- How data flows between devices
- Which device acts as GATT server vs client
- Relationship to phone-facing services

## Benefits for Mobile App Developers

The updated specification provides:
1. Complete UUID reference for all services
2. Clear understanding of device architecture
3. Implementation guidance for proxy services
4. Protocol details for FOTA and file operations
5. D2D communication understanding for debugging

The document now serves as a complete reference for all BLE interactions with both primary and secondary devices.
