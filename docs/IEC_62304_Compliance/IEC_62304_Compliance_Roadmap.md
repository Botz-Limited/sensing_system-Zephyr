# IEC 62304 Class A Compliance Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Purpose:** Define the path to IEC 62304 Class A compliance for the sensing firmware

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements and roadmap for achieving IEC 62304 Class A compliance for the sensing firmware, enabling its use in clinical studies.
