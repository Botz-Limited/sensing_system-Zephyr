## üöÄ Start Here - What Class is My Software?

```
Can software failure cause:
‚îú‚îÄ Death or serious injury? ‚Üí Class C
‚îú‚îÄ Non-serious injury? ‚Üí Class B  
‚îî‚îÄ No injury? ‚Üí Class A
```

## üìã Development Checklist by Class

### Class A (Basic Safety)
- [x] Requirements doc (SWRS)
- [x] Design doc (SWDS)
- [x] Test against requirements
- [x] Basic code review
- [x] Release documentation

### Class B (Medium Safety)
Everything from Class A plus:
- [x] Detailed design required
- [x] Integration testing
- [x] Static code analysis
- [x] Unit testing
- [x] Qualified tools only

### Class C (High Safety)
Everything from Class B plus:
- [x] Extra verification rigor
- [x] Complete traceability
- [x] Formal reviews
- [x] 100% code coverage target

## üîÑ The Process Flow

```
1. PLAN
   ‚îú‚îÄ Classify software (A/B/C)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Create development plan
   ‚îî‚îÄ Set up tools & environment

2. SPECIFY
   ‚îú‚îÄ Write requirements (SWRS)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Get requirements reviewed
   ‚îî‚îÄ Each requirement gets unique ID

3. DESIGN  
   ‚îú‚îÄ Architecture design first
   ‚îú‚îÄ Then detailed design (SWDS)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Design review before coding!

4. CODE
   ‚îú‚îÄ Follow coding standards
   ‚îú‚îÄ Implement per design (no ad-hoc!)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Code review (mandatory for B/C)

5. TEST
   ‚îú‚îÄ Unit tests (B/C only)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Integration tests (B/C only)
   ‚îú‚îÄ Requirements verification (all)
   ‚îî‚îÄ Document ALL failures

6. RELEASE
   ‚îú‚îÄ Resolve or document issues
   ‚îú‚îÄ Archive source code
   ‚îî‚îÄ Create release package
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes (Don't Do These!)

### ‚ùå Starting to code before design is approved
**Do instead:** Complete SWDS and get it reviewed first

### ‚ùå Using unqualified tools for Class B/C
**Do instead:** Check WI-XXXX for qualified tools list

### ‚ùå Testing without documentation
**Do instead:** Use test record template for everything

### ‚ùå Ignoring compiler warnings
**Do instead:** Fix them or document why they're OK

### ‚ùå Making design changes during coding
**Do instead:** Update SWDS first, then code

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Required Tools by Class

### Class A - Use Whatever Works
- Any IDE
- Any compiler
- Basic version control

### Class B/C - Qualified Tools Only
- **IDE**: Qualified versions only
- **Compiler**: Document version & settings
- **Static Analysis**: PC-Lint, Coverity
- **Unit Test**: Unity, Google Test
- **Version Control**: Git with documented workflow

---

## üìä Key Metrics to Track

| Metric | Target | Class |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Requirements Coverage | 100% | All |
| Code Review Coverage | 100% | B, C |
| Unit Test Coverage | >80% | B, C |
| Static Analysis Issues | 0 Critical | B, C |
| Compiler Warnings | 0 | B, C |

---

## üîç Review Gates (Can't Skip These!)

### Gate 1: Requirements Review (SWRS)
- Requirements complete?
- Each one testable?
- Safety class assigned?

### Gate 2: Design Review (SWDS)
- Covers all requirements?
- Detailed enough to code from?
- Test approach defined?

### Gate 3: Code Review
- Follows standards?
- Matches design?
- No compiler warnings?

### Gate 4: Test Review
- All requirements tested?
- Failures documented?
- Ready for release?

## üìû Who to Contact

| Question About | Contact |
|----------------|---------|
| Requirements unclear | Product Manager |
| Design decisions | Lead Software Developer |
| Test failures | Software Quality Engineer |
| Process questions | Quality Department |
| Tool problems | IT Support |

---

## üö® When to Stop and Escalate

STOP development and escalate if:
- Safety class might be wrong
- Major design change needed
- Critical bug found late
- Can't meet schedule
- Regulatory requirement unclear

---

## üìÖ Time Estimates (Typical)

| Activity | Class A | Class B | Class C |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Requirements | 1 week | 2 weeks | 3 weeks |
| Design | 1 week | 2 weeks | 3 weeks |
| Implementation | X weeks | X weeks | X weeks |
| Unit Testing | Optional | +20% | +30% |
| Integration Test | N/A | 1 week | 2 weeks |
| Documentation | 3 days | 1 week | 2 weeks |

## ‚úÖ Release Readiness Checklist

Before declaring "Done":

- [ ] All requirements have test results
- [ ] All test failures resolved or documented
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Version number assigned
- [ ] Source code archived
- [ ] Build instructions documented
- [ ] Release notes written
- [ ] Unresolved issues in USWAR
- [ ] All documents signed off

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start documentation early** - Don't leave it to the end
2. **Use meaningful commit messages** - They're part of traceability
3. **Test as you go** - Don't accumulate technical debt
4. **Keep safety in mind** - If unsure, classify higher
5. **Communicate issues early** - Surprises at release are bad

---

**Remember: When in doubt, ask! Better to clarify than to redo work.**
