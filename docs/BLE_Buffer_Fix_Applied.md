# BLE Buffer Fix - Successfully Applied

## What Was Fixed

The Kconfig warnings were caused by inline comments in the configuration file. Kconfig doesn't support comments on the same line as values.

### Changes Made:

1. **Removed inline comments** - Changed from:
   ```
   CONFIG_BT_ATT_TX_COUNT=10          # Increased from default 3
   ```
   To:
   ```
   CONFIG_BT_ATT_TX_COUNT=10
   ```

2. **Removed invalid configurations**:
   - `CONFIG_BT_CTLR_TX_BUFFERS` - Not available for nRF5340
   - `CONFIG_BT_GATT_CLIENT_MAX_MTU` - Invalid config name

3. **Successfully applied configurations**:
   - `CONFIG_BT_ATT_TX_COUNT=10` (was default 3)
   - `CONFIG_BT_L2CAP_TX_BUF_COUNT=16` (was 8)
   - `CONFIG_BT_CONN_TX_MAX=20` (was 10)
   - `CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_TX_COUNT=16` (new)
   - `CONFIG_BT_BUF_ACL_RX_COUNT=16` (new)
   - `CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE=20480` (was 4096)

## Build Status

âœ… Build completed successfully with the new buffer configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Flash the firmware** to your device
2. **Monitor RTT logs** to verify the buffer warnings are gone
3. **Test the stop activity characteristic** again

## Expected Results

With these buffer increases, you should no longer see:
- "No ATT channel for MTU 32" warnings
- "No buffer available to send notification" warnings

## MTU Issue

The MTU of 32 bytes is still concerning. To fix this, ensure your application code requests MTU exchange after connection:

```c
// Add to your connection callback
static void connected(struct bt_conn *conn, uint8_t err)
{
    if (!err) {
        struct bt_gatt_exchange_params exchange_params = {
            .func = mtu_exchange_cb,
        };
        
        int ret = bt_gatt_exchange_mtu(conn, &exchange_params);
        if (ret) {
            LOG_WRN("MTU exchange failed (err %d)", ret);
        }
    }
}
```

## Memory Usage

The configuration changes increased RAM usage by approximately 16KB:
- Previous heap: 4KB
- New heap: 20KB
- Additional buffer memory: ~12KB

Total RAM increase: ~16KB

This is a reasonable trade-off for stable BLE communication.
