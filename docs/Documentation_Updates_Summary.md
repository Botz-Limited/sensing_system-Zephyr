## Documents Reviewed (No Updates Needed)

### 1. BHI360_Complete_Integration_Guide
- Already contains comprehensive calibration documentation
- Covers calibration methods, status levels, and best practices
- No updates needed for the trigger functionality

### 2. Command_Flow_Detailed_Options
- Contains flow diagram options
- No specific command details that need updating

### 3. Sensor_Logging_Specification
- Focuses on logging functionality
- No calibration-related content to update

### 4. Other BHI360 Documents
- BHI360_Calibration_Final_Analysis.md
- BHI360_Calibration_Reliability_Analysis.md
- BHI360_Calibration_Storage_Guide.md
- BHI360_Data_Flow_Analysis.md
- BHI360_Driver_Integration_Test_Plan.md

These documents contain analysis and implementation details but don't need updates for the new characteristic.

## Summary

The documentation has been successfully updated to include the new BHI360 calibration trigger functionality. The updates maintain consistency across both Markdown and Coda versions of the documents. The new characteristic follows the established patterns for command characteristics in both the Control Service and D2D communication system.

Key additions:
- Control Service: `...b686` for direct phone-to-primary calibration trigger
- D2D RX Service: `...ca86` for primary-to-secondary calibration trigger
- Both characteristics use the same simple protocol: write 1 to trigger calibration

The implementation allows users to trigger BHI360 sensor calibration from the mobile app, with the command automatically forwarded to the secondary device when needed.
