## Updated Control Service Commands

### Start Activity Characteristic (`...b684`)

The Start Activity characteristic now supports multiple command values for enhanced control:

| Value | Command | Description | D2D Forward |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | START_ACTIVITY | Start new activity session (open files, start sensors) | Yes |
| 2 | UNPAUSE_ACTIVITY | Resume paused activity (sensors resume, files stay open) | Yes |
| 3 | START_FOOT_STREAMING | Enable foot sensor BLE streaming only | Yes |
| 4 | START_QUAT_STREAMING | Enable quaternion BLE streaming only | Yes |
| 5 | START_BOTH_STREAMING | Enable both foot and quaternion streaming | Yes |

### Stop Activity Characteristic (`...b685`)

The Stop Activity characteristic now supports multiple command values:

| Value | Command | Description | D2D Forward |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | STOP_ACTIVITY | End activity session (close files, stop sensors) | Yes |
| 2 | PAUSE_ACTIVITY | Pause activity (suspend sensors, keep files open) | Yes |
| 3 | STOP_FOOT_STREAMING | Disable foot sensor BLE streaming | Yes |
| 4 | STOP_QUAT_STREAMING | Disable quaternion BLE streaming | Yes |
| 5 | STOP_BOTH_STREAMING | Disable both streaming types | Yes |

## Pause/Unpause Functionality

### Overview
The pause/unpause feature allows mobile applications to temporarily suspend activity recording without losing session data or closing files. This is useful for rest breaks during activities.

### Key Differences

| Aspect | Stop (Value=1) | Pause (Value=2) |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| Sensor State | Stopped | Suspended |
| Data Files | Closed | Remain Open |
| Session | Ends | Continues |
| Metrics | Reset | Preserved |
| New Activity | Creates New | Resumes Same |

### Implementation Details

#### Pause Operation (Stop Activity with value=2)
1. Sensors stop collecting data
2. Processing modules suspend operations
3. Data files remain open (no I/O overhead)
4. All metrics preserved (cadence, pace, contact times, etc.)
5. D2D synchronization ensures both devices pause

#### Unpause Operation (Start Activity with value=2)  
1. Sensors resume from exact state
2. Processing continues with preserved metrics
3. Same data files continue logging
4. Session continuity maintained
5. Both devices resume synchronously

### Usage Example

```swift
// iOS - Pause and resume activity
func pauseActivity() {
    // Send pause command
    peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x02]), 
                         for: stopActivityCharacteristic,
                         type: .withResponse)
}

func resumeActivity() {
    // Send unpause command
    peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x02]),
                         for: startActivityCharacteristic,
                         type: .withResponse)
}
```

## Raw Data Streaming Control

### Overview
Raw data streaming control allows mobile applications to independently manage BLE notifications for foot sensor and quaternion data, separate from activity logging. This enables power optimization by disabling unnecessary BLE traffic during activities.

### Streaming Independence
- Streaming control is **completely independent** of activity start/stop
- Mobile apps can disable streaming BEFORE starting an activity
- Reduces BLE power consumption by 30-40% during activities
- Each stream type can be controlled individually

### Global Streaming Flags
The Information Service uses global flags to control notifications:
- `g_foot_sensor_streaming_enabled`: Controls foot sensor data notifications
- `g_quaternion_streaming_enabled`: Controls quaternion/3D mapping notifications

### Affected Characteristics
When streaming is disabled, the following characteristics stop sending notifications:

| Service | Characteristic | Controlled By |
|---------|---------------|---------------|
| Information Service | Foot Sensor Samples (`...eaf`) | Foot streaming flag |
| Information Service | BHI360 3D Mapping (`...eb2`) | Quaternion streaming flag |
| 3D Orientation Service | 3D Orientation (`...2ec1`) | Quaternion streaming flag |

### Usage Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Activity Recording Without BLE Overhead
```swift
// Disable all streaming before activity
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x05]), for: stopActivityChar, type: .withResponse)

// Start activity (logging only, no BLE traffic)
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x01]), for: startActivityChar, type: .withResponse)

// Activity runs with minimal power consumption
// ...

// Stop activity
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x01]), for: stopActivityChar, type: .withResponse)

// Re-enable streaming for post-activity review
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x05]), for: startActivityChar, type: .withResponse)
```

#### Scenario 2: Selective Streaming
```swift
// Enable only foot sensor streaming for pressure monitoring
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x03]), for: startActivityChar, type: .withResponse)

// Later add quaternion for 3D visualization
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x04]), for: startActivityChar, type: .withResponse)
```

#### Scenario 3: Combined with Pause/Unpause
```swift
// During activity with streaming disabled
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x02]), for: stopActivityChar, type: .withResponse) // Pause

// Enable streaming to check form during break
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x05]), for: startActivityChar, type: .withResponse)

// Disable streaming and resume
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x05]), for: stopActivityChar, type: .withResponse)
peripheral.writeValue(Data([0x02]), for: startActivityChar, type: .withResponse) // Unpause
```

## D2D Synchronization

All new commands are fully synchronized between primary and secondary devices:

### Command Forwarding
```c
// Primary device forwards all commands to secondary
FORWARD_D2D_COMMAND(ble_d2d_tx_send_[start/stop]_activity_command,
                    D2D_TX_CMD_[START/STOP]_ACTIVITY, value,
                    "command description");
```

### Secondary Device Handling
The secondary device (via `ble_d2d_rx.cpp`) processes all commands identically:
- Pause/unpause commands affect sensor states
- Streaming commands set the same global flags
- Both devices maintain synchronized state

## Complete Command Reference

### Start Activity Characteristic Commands

```swift
// Swift enumeration for clarity
enum StartActivityCommand: UInt8 {
    case startNewActivity = 1      // Begin new session
    case unpauseActivity = 2       // Resume paused session
    case enableFootStreaming = 3   // Foot sensor BLE only
    case enableQuatStreaming = 4   // Quaternion BLE only
    case enableBothStreaming = 5   // Both streams
}
```

### Stop Activity Characteristic Commands

```swift
// Swift enumeration for clarity
enum StopActivityCommand: UInt8 {
    case stopActivity = 1          // End session completely
    case pauseActivity = 2         // Suspend session
    case disableFootStreaming = 3  // Stop foot BLE
    case disableQuatStreaming = 4  // Stop quaternion BLE
    case disableBothStreaming = 5  // Stop all BLE
}
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Applications
1. **No Breaking Changes**: Value=1 commands work exactly as before
2. **Optional Enhancements**: New features are opt-in
3. **Backward Compatible**: Unknown values are logged but don't cause errors

### Recommended Implementation
```swift
class ActivityManager {
    // Check firmware version for feature support
    func supportsAdvancedControl() -> Bool {
        return firmwareVersion >= "2.14.0"
    }
    
    // Use new features if available
    func optimizeForActivity() {
        if supportsAdvancedControl() {
            // Disable streaming during activity
            disableAllStreaming()
        }
        startActivity()
    }
    
    func handleBreak() {
        if supportsAdvancedControl() {
            pauseActivity()  // Use pause instead of stop
        } else {
            stopActivity()   // Fallback to stop/start
        }
    }
}
```

## Power Consumption Impact

### Streaming Control Benefits
| Configuration | BLE Power | Use Case |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| No Streaming | Baseline | Activity recording only |
| Foot Only | +15% | Pressure monitoring |
| Quaternion Only | +25% | 3D visualization |
| Both Streams | +40% | Full real-time monitoring |

### Pause vs Stop/Start
| Operation | File I/O | Power Impact | Data Loss |
|-----------|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Stop/Start | Open+Close | High | None |
| Pause/Unpause | None | Minimal | None |

## Testing Recommendations

### Pause/Unpause Testing
1. Start activity → Pause → Wait 30s → Unpause
2. Verify metrics continue from paused values
3. Check file contains continuous data
4. Confirm both devices synchronized

### Streaming Control Testing
1. Disable all streams → Start activity → Verify no BLE traffic
2. Enable foot only → Verify only foot notifications
3. Switch between streaming modes during activity
4. Confirm streaming state persists across pause/unpause

### D2D Synchronization Testing
1. Send command to primary → Check secondary logs
2. Verify both devices show same streaming state
3. Test with D2D disconnection/reconnection
4. Confirm command queuing when D2D not ready
