## üéØ Where to Start

### For Mobile App Developers
1. Start with **[Bluetooth GATT Specification](Bluetooth_GATT_Specification.md)**
2. Review **[Activity Session Calculated Data Specification](Activity_Session_Calculated_Data_Specification.md)** for understanding data formats
3. Check Section 7.2 in GATT spec for 3D Orientation Service

### For Firmware Developers
1. Read **[Developer Quick Reference](Developer_Quick_Reference.md)**
2. Review relevant implementation guides (BHI360, D2D, FOTA)
3. Use **[Test Framework Guide](Test_Framework_Guide.md)** for testing

### For System Architects
1. Review **[Activity Session Calculated Data Specification](Activity_Session_Calculated_Data_Specification.md)** for data architecture
2. Check analysis documents for sensor capabilities
3. Review **[nRF5340 Power and Battery Guide](nRF5340_Power_and_Battery_Guide.md)** for power budgets

## üìù Document Formats

- **.md files** - Standard Markdown format, viewable in any text editor or GitHub
- **.coda files** - Coda-specific format with enhanced formatting and diagrams

Both formats contain the same content. Use whichever format works best for your workflow.

## üîÑ Recent Updates

- **Activity Logging** added to sensor logging system
  - New activity log file type for session-based metrics
  - BLE characteristics for activity log management
  - Integration with existing foot and BHI360 logging
- **3D Orientation Service** added to Bluetooth GATT Specification
- **Activity Session Calculated Data Specification** finalized with binary format
- Consolidated 3D orientation documentation into main GATT spec
