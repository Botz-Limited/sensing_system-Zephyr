# D2D Implementation Status

## What's Implemented ✓

### 1. Service Architecture
- D2D RX Service fully defined with all characteristics
- D2D TX module structure in place
- Proper role separation (Primary/Secondary)

### 2. Command Handlers (D2D RX)
- ✓ Set time command handler
- ✓ Delete foot log command handler  
- ✓ Delete BHI360 log command handler
- ✓ Start activity command handler
- ✓ Stop activity command handler

### 3. Command Forwarding (Control Service)
- ✓ All control service handlers forward commands to D2D TX
- ✓ Proper conditional compilation guards

### 4. Build System
- ✓ CMakeLists.txt properly configured
- ✓ Both devices compile D2D TX and RX modules
- ✓ Role-specific service compilation

## What Still Needs Implementation ❌

### 1. GATT Write Operations in D2D TX Module

All command forwarding functions are **placeholders** that only log messages:

```cpp
// Current implementation (example from ble_d2d_tx.cpp)
int ble_d2d_tx_send_set_time_command(uint32_t epoch_time) {
    if (!d2d_conn) return -ENOTCONN;
    
    LOG_INF("D2D TX: Forwarding set time command - epoch: %u", epoch_time);
    
    // TODO: Implement actual GATT write to secondary device
    // Example pseudo-code:
    // uint16_t handle = get_d2d_set_time_handle();
    // bt_gatt_write_without_response(d2d_conn, handle, &epoch_time, sizeof(epoch_time), false);
    
    return 0;  // <-- Just returns success without sending anything!
}
```

### 2. Service Discovery

Missing implementation for:
- Discovering D2D RX service on the peer device
- Finding characteristic handles
- Storing handles for efficient writes

### 3. GATT Client Implementation

Need to implement:
- `bt_gatt_discover()` for service/characteristic discovery
- `bt_gatt_write()` or `bt_gatt_write_without_response()` for sending commands
- Proper callbacks for discovery completion
- Handle caching mechanism

### 4. Connection Management

Current issues:
- `d2d_conn` is set but not used for actual GATT operations
- No validation that D2D services are available on peer
- No retry mechanism for failed writes

## Required Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Add Service Discovery
```cpp
// Example structure needed
struct d2d_handles {
    uint16_t rx_service_handle;
    uint16_t set_time_handle;
    uint16_t delete_foot_log_handle;
    uint16_t delete_bhi360_log_handle;
    uint16_t start_activity_handle;
    uint16_t stop_activity_handle;
};

static struct d2d_handles discovered_handles;
```

### Step 2: Implement Discovery Callback
```cpp
static uint8_t discover_func(struct bt_conn *conn,
                            const struct bt_gatt_attr *attr,
                            struct bt_gatt_discover_params *params)
{
    // Store discovered handles
    // Continue discovery for all characteristics
}
```

### Step 3: Update Command Functions
Replace TODO sections with actual GATT writes:
```cpp
int ble_d2d_tx_send_set_time_command(uint32_t epoch_time) {
    if (!d2d_conn || !discovered_handles.set_time_handle) {
        return -ENOTCONN;
    }
    
    return bt_gatt_write_without_response(d2d_conn, 
                                         discovered_handles.set_time_handle,
                                         &epoch_time, 
                                         sizeof(epoch_time), 
                                         false);
}
```

## Impact of Missing Implementation

Currently, the system will:
1. **Log command forwarding** but not actually send commands
2. **Secondary device won't receive** any forwarded commands
3. **Time synchronization won't work** between devices
4. **Activity start/stop won't synchronize**
5. **Log deletion won't propagate** to secondary device

## Testing Considerations

Until GATT writes are implemented:
- Commands will appear to succeed (return 0) but won't reach secondary
- Logs will show forwarding messages but no actual transmission
- Secondary device handlers are ready but won't be triggered

## Priority

This is a **HIGH PRIORITY** implementation gap that prevents the D2D command forwarding from functioning. The architecture is ready, but without actual GATT writes, commands cannot flow from primary to secondary device.
