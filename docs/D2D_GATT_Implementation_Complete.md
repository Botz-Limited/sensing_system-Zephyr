# D2D GATT Implementation Complete

## Overview

The D2D (Device-to-Device) GATT communication has been fully implemented to forward control commands from the primary device to the secondary device. This enables synchronized operation between both feet devices.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Service Discovery

Implemented a complete service discovery mechanism in `ble_d2d_tx.cpp`:

```cpp
// Discovery state machine
enum discover_state {
    DISCOVER_SERVICE,
    DISCOVER_SET_TIME_CHAR,
    DISCOVER_DELETE_FOOT_LOG_CHAR,
    DISCOVER_DELETE_BHI360_LOG_CHAR,
    DISCOVER_START_ACTIVITY_CHAR,
    DISCOVER_STOP_ACTIVITY_CHAR,
    DISCOVER_COMPLETE
};
```

**Features:**
- Automatic discovery triggered on connection
- Sequential discovery of service and all characteristics
- Handle storage for efficient writes
- Error handling and state management

### 2. GATT Write Implementation

All command forwarding functions now use actual GATT writes:

```cpp
int ble_d2d_tx_send_set_time_command(uint32_t epoch_time) {
    // Validation checks
    if (!d2d_conn) return -ENOTCONN;
    if (!d2d_handles.discovery_complete) return -EINVAL;
    
    // Actual GATT write
    return bt_gatt_write_without_response(d2d_conn, 
                                         d2d_handles.set_time_handle,
                                         &epoch_time, 
                                         sizeof(epoch_time), 
                                         false);
}
```

### 3. Command Flow

```
Mobile Phone
    ↓
Primary Device (Control Service)
    ├── Process command locally
    └── Forward via D2D TX ──────► Secondary Device (D2D RX Service)
                                          └── Process command
```

### 4. Implemented Commands

All control commands are now properly forwarded:

1. **Set Time Command**
   - Synchronizes RTC time between devices
   - Ensures both feet have same time reference

2. **Delete Foot Log Command**
   - Deletes specified log files on both devices
   - Maintains consistent storage state

3. **Delete BHI360 Log Command**
   - Removes motion sensor logs on both devices
   - Keeps data management synchronized

4. **Start Activity Command**
   - Starts recording on both devices simultaneously
   - Ensures synchronized data collection

5. **Stop Activity Command**
   - Stops recording on both devices
   - Maintains data consistency

## Key Features

### Connection Management
- Discovery starts automatically when D2D connection is established
- Handles cleared when connection is lost
- Proper error codes returned if discovery incomplete

### Error Handling
- Connection validation before writes
- Discovery completion checks
- GATT write error propagation
- Detailed logging for debugging

### Performance
- Uses `bt_gatt_write_without_response()` for low latency
- Cached handles avoid repeated discovery
- Minimal overhead for command forwarding

## Testing Guide

### Expected Log Sequence

1. **Connection Establishment**
```
D2D TX connection set
Started D2D service discovery
```

2. **Service Discovery**
```
Found D2D RX service, handle: XX
Found set time characteristic, handle: XX
Found delete foot log characteristic, handle: XX
...
D2D service discovery complete!
```

3. **Command Forwarding**
```
D2D TX: Forwarding set time command - epoch: 1234567890 to handle: XX
D2D RX: Set Time Command - epoch: 1234567890
```

### Error Scenarios

1. **No Connection**
```
D2D TX: No connection
```

2. **Discovery Incomplete**
```
D2D TX: Service discovery not complete or handle not found
```

3. **Write Failure**
```
D2D TX: Failed to send command (err -XX)
```

## Integration Points

### Primary Device
- Control Service handlers call D2D TX functions
- Conditional compilation ensures primary-only execution
- Error handling allows graceful degradation

### Secondary Device
- D2D RX handlers process commands identically to Control Service
- No awareness needed of command source (phone vs primary)
- Same business logic execution

## Future Enhancements

1. **Write with Response**
   - For critical commands requiring acknowledgment
   - Implement retry mechanism

2. **Notification Support**
   - Secondary could notify primary of command completion
   - Enable status feedback to phone

3. **Batch Commands**
   - Group multiple commands in single write
   - Reduce power consumption

4. **Security**
   - Add encryption for sensitive commands
   - Implement command authentication

## Verification

The implementation is complete and functional:
- ✅ Service discovery implemented
- ✅ Handle management in place
- ✅ All GATT writes implemented
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Integration with existing code

Commands from the mobile phone will now be properly forwarded to and executed on the secondary device, ensuring synchronized operation of both feet.
