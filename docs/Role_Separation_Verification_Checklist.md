# Role Separation Verification Checklist

## Build System Verification ✓

### CMakeLists.txt
- [x] Primary includes both D2D TX and RX modules
- [x] Secondary includes both D2D TX and RX modules  
- [x] Control/Information services ONLY on primary
- [x] FOTA/File proxy ONLY on primary

## Code Separation Verification ✓

### Device Names
- [x] Primary: `bt_set_name("SensingGR")` - Right foot
- [x] Secondary: `bt_set_name("SensingGL")` - Left foot

### Connection Behavior
- [x] Primary: Advertises to phone (`bt_start_advertising`)
- [x] Primary: Accepts secondary connection (peripheral role)
- [x] Secondary: Scans for primary (`start_scan`)
- [x] Secondary: NEVER advertises to phone
- [x] Secondary: Connects to primary (central role)

### Service Exposure
- [x] Primary exposes Control Service to phone
- [x] Primary exposes Information Service to phone
- [x] Primary exposes D2D RX Service to secondary
- [x] Secondary exposes D2D RX Service to primary
- [x] Secondary does NOT expose phone-facing services

### Command Flow
- [x] Control service handlers forward to secondary (with `#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE)`)
- [x] D2D RX handlers process commands identically to Control Service
- [x] No command forwarding from secondary

### Data Flow
- [x] Secondary sends sensor data via D2D TX
- [x] Primary receives and forwards to phone (with `#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE)`)
- [x] Primary aggregates data from both feet

## Potential Issues Addressed ✓

### 1. Service Compilation
- Fixed: Both devices now compile D2D TX and RX modules
- Primary has bidirectional D2D communication
- Secondary has bidirectional D2D communication

### 2. Role Confusion Prevention
- Clear comments in D2D modules explaining dual usage
- Conditional compilation guards on all role-specific code
- Device name clearly indicates role (GR/GL)

### 3. Connection Management
- Primary manages `conn` (phone) and `d2d_conn` (secondary)
- Secondary only manages connection to primary
- No cross-contamination of connection handles

## Testing Protocol

### Primary Device Test
```bash
# Build
west build -b <board> -- -DCONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE=y

# Expected behavior:
1. Device advertises as "SensingGR"
2. Phone can connect and see Control/Information services
3. Secondary device can connect
4. Commands from phone are forwarded to secondary
5. Data from secondary is forwarded to phone
```

### Secondary Device Test
```bash
# Build
west build -b <board> -- -DCONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE=n

# Expected behavior:
1. Device scans for "SensingGR"
2. Connects to primary when found
3. Receives forwarded commands via D2D RX
4. Sends sensor data via D2D TX
5. NO direct phone interaction
```

## Code Review Points

### 1. Bluetooth.cpp
- [x] Proper `#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE)` guards
- [x] Advertising only on primary
- [x] Scanning only on secondary
- [x] Notification forwarding only on primary

### 2. Control Service
- [x] Only compiled for primary
- [x] All handlers forward commands with proper guards
- [x] No secondary device code

### 3. D2D Modules
- [x] Clear documentation of dual purpose
- [x] Both modules compiled for both devices
- [x] Proper initialization in bluetooth.cpp

### 4. Information Service
- [x] Only compiled for primary
- [x] Handles notifications to phone
- [x] No secondary device code

## Security Considerations

### 1. Service Discovery
- Secondary should only discover D2D services on primary
- Primary should validate secondary before accepting D2D data
- No phone services exposed on secondary

### 2. Command Validation
- Commands forwarded from primary are trusted
- Secondary validates command parameters
- No direct command injection possible

### 3. Data Integrity
- All D2D data should be validated
- Primary aggregates but doesn't modify secondary data
- Clear data source tracking (SENDER_D2D_SECONDARY)

## Final Verification

The role separation is now complete and verified:

1. **Build System**: Properly separates services by role
2. **Runtime Behavior**: Clear distinction between primary/secondary
3. **Communication**: Bidirectional D2D with proper flow control
4. **Security**: No service leakage between roles
5. **Maintainability**: Clear code organization and documentation

The firmware can be safely built for either role without risk of:
- Service contamination
- Role confusion
- Improper connections
- Command/data flow errors
