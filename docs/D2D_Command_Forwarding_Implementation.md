# D2D Command Forwarding Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of command forwarding from the primary device to the secondary device via D2D (device-to-device) communication. The primary device now forwards all control service commands it receives from the mobile phone to the secondary device.

## Architecture

### Command Flow
1. Mobile phone sends command to primary device via Control Service
2. Primary device processes the command locally
3. Primary device forwards the command to secondary device via D2D TX
4. Secondary device receives command via D2D RX service and processes it

### Supported Commands

The following commands from the Control Service are now forwarded:

1. **Set Time Command**
   - Sets the RTC time on both devices
   - Ensures time synchronization between primary and secondary

2. **Delete Foot Log Command**
   - Deletes specified foot sensor log files on both devices
   - Accepts log ID as parameter

3. **Delete BHI360 Log Command**
   - Deletes specified BHI360 sensor log files on both devices
   - Accepts log ID as parameter

4. **Start Activity Command**
   - Starts activity recording on both devices
   - Triggers foot sensor and motion sensor events

5. **Stop Activity Command**
   - Stops activity recording on both devices
   - Triggers foot sensor and motion sensor events

## Implementation Details

### D2D RX Service (Secondary Device)

The D2D RX service (`ble_d2d_rx.cpp`) has been updated with proper handlers that mirror the Control Service functionality:

- Each handler validates input parameters
- Processes commands exactly as the Control Service would
- Sends appropriate messages to data module or triggers events
- Logs command reception for debugging

### D2D TX Module (Primary Device)

The D2D TX module (`ble_d2d_tx.cpp/hpp`) has been extended with command forwarding functions:

- `ble_d2d_tx_send_set_time_command()`
- `ble_d2d_tx_send_delete_foot_log_command()`
- `ble_d2d_tx_send_delete_bhi360_log_command()`
- `ble_d2d_tx_send_start_activity_command()`
- `ble_d2d_tx_send_stop_activity_command()`

Note: The actual GATT write implementation is marked as TODO and needs to be completed with proper service discovery and characteristic handle management.

### Control Service Updates

The Control Service (`control_service.cpp`) has been updated to forward commands:

- Each command handler now includes conditional compilation for primary device
- After processing locally, commands are forwarded via D2D TX functions
- Forwarding only occurs on primary device (CONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE=y)

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test each D2D RX handler with valid and invalid inputs
   - Verify command forwarding on primary device
   - Ensure secondary device doesn't attempt forwarding

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Send commands from mobile app to primary device
   - Verify both devices execute the command
   - Check time synchronization between devices
   - Verify log deletion on both devices

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test behavior when D2D connection is lost
   - Verify graceful handling of forwarding failures
   - Check parameter validation on both sides

## Future Improvements

1. **Complete GATT Implementation**
   - Implement proper service discovery for D2D RX service
   - Store characteristic handles for efficient writes
   - Use write with response for critical commands

2. **Command Acknowledgment**
   - Add acknowledgment mechanism from secondary to primary
   - Implement retry logic for failed commands
   - Report forwarding status back to mobile app

3. **Batch Commands**
   - Optimize multiple commands into single D2D transfer
   - Reduce power consumption for frequent commands

4. **Security**
   - Add command authentication between devices
   - Implement command sequence numbers to prevent replay

## Configuration

The implementation uses conditional compilation:
- Primary device: `CONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE=y`
- Secondary device: `CONFIG_PRIMARY_DEVICE=n`

Only the primary device includes the D2D TX forwarding code, while both devices include the D2D RX handlers.
