## 4. New Documentation

### Fixed-Point Data Format (Now Integrated)

The fixed-point data format specification is now fully integrated into the main Bluetooth GATT Specification document, covering:
- Benefits of fixed-point format
- Detailed data structures
- Conversion examples
- BLE packet format
- Implementation notes
- Migration guide

## 5. Key Benefits Documented

### Bandwidth Reduction
- BLE transmission: 40% reduction
- 50Hz data rate: 2400 B/s → 1450 B/s

### Storage Efficiency
- Log files: 42% smaller
- 50Hz logging: 10 MB/hour → 5.8 MB/hour

### Improved Portability
- No floating-point endianness issues
- Consistent integer representation
- Simplified mobile app parsing

## 6. Developer Resources Added

### Code Examples
- Swift/iOS BLE characteristic parsing
- Kotlin/Android data handling
- Python log file decoding
- C/C++ conversion functions

### Migration Support
- Step-by-step checklist
- Scale factor reference table
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Testing recommendations

## 7. Diagram Improvements

All ASCII art diagrams have been converted to Mermaid format:
- Better rendering in documentation tools
- Easier to maintain and update
- Support for various diagram types:
  - Flowcharts
  - Sequence diagrams
  - State diagrams
  - Graph visualizations

## Recommendations for Developers

1. **Review Bluetooth_GATT_Specification.md** for complete BLE interface details
2. **Consult Sensor_Logging_Specification.md** for logging implementation
3. **Use provided code examples** as starting points for integration
4. **Test with fixed-point conversion** before deployment
5. **Monitor bandwidth and storage usage** to verify improvements
6. **Update mobile apps** to handle new data formats
