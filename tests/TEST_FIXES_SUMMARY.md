# Test Fixes Summary

## Overview
Fixed failing unit tests in the Sensing FW project by addressing mock implementation issues and test fixture initialization problems.

## Initial State
- **Failed modules**: 4 out of 9
- **Total failing tests**: 16

## Final State
- **Failed modules**: 2 out of 9 (app, packetizer)
- **Total failing tests**: 3
- **Success rate**: 81% improvement

## Fixes Applied

### 1. App Module Tests
**Issues Fixed**:
- Added proper fixture initialization in `app_setup()`
- Reset message counts before tests that check notifications
- Fixed teardown to properly reset state

**Remaining Issue**:
- `test_get_fota_progress`: Still seeing initialization issue, possibly due to test execution order

### 2. Bluetooth Module Tests ✓
**All tests now passing!**
- Fixed initialization state in mock functions
- Added proper state management for connections
- Reset scanning state in state transition tests

### 3. Data Module Tests ✓
**All tests now passing!**
- Ensured file system mount state is properly initialized
- Fixed ID management in file operations
- Added state resets before each test

### 4. Packetizer Module Tests
**Issues Fixed**:
- Fixed sequence number initialization
- Improved state machine for sync byte detection
- Fixed header parsing after sync bytes

**Remaining Issues**:
- `test_parse`: State machine not reaching COMPLETE state
- `test_statistics`: Related to parsing issue

## Key Learnings

1. **Mock Initialization**: Tests were expecting certain initial states but mocks weren't providing them
2. **State Management**: Many tests needed explicit state resets between test cases
3. **Test Isolation**: Some tests were affected by state from previous tests
4. **Mock Behavior**: Mocks need to match expected behavior, not just return values

## Recommendations

1. **Short term**: 
   - Add explicit state initialization at the start of each test
   - Consider using a fresh fixture for each test

2. **Long term**:
   - Implement proper dependency injection for better testability
   - Consider using a mocking framework that can intercept actual function calls
   - Add integration tests to complement unit tests

## Test Architecture Issues

The tests are written as unit tests with local mock implementations, but the assertions expect behaviors that would come from actual implementations. This creates a disconnect between what's being tested and what's being asserted.

### Solutions:
1. **Pure Unit Tests**: Test only the mock behavior
2. **Integration Tests**: Link actual implementations
3. **Hybrid Approach**: Mock only external dependencies

## Next Steps

To fix the remaining 3 failing tests:
1. Debug the app test initialization issue - may need to check test execution order
2. Fix packetizer state machine to properly handle complete packet parsing
3. Consider refactoring tests to be more isolated and self-contained
