# D2D Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementations

### 1. FOTA Progress Callbacks for Both Devices
- ✅ Primary device: FOTA callbacks registered and progress sent to phone via Information Service
- ✅ Secondary device: FOTA callbacks registered and progress tracked locally
- ✅ Secondary device: FOTA completion notification sent to primary via D2D
- ✅ Secondary device: FOTA progress forwarding stub added (needs GATT characteristic)

### 2. Command Cascading (Phone → Primary → Secondary)
All control service commands are properly cascaded:
- ✅ Set Time - Working
- ✅ Delete Foot Log - Working
- ✅ Delete BHI360 Log - Working
- ✅ Start Activity - Working
- ✅ Stop Activity - Working
- ✅ Trigger BHI360 Calibration - Working
- ❌ Delete Activity Log - Missing in D2D RX service

### 3. Data Flow (Secondary → Primary → Phone)
Most sensor data flows are working:
- ✅ Foot Sensor Data - Working
- ✅ BHI360 3D Mapping Data - Working
- ✅ BHI360 Step Count - Working
- ✅ BHI360 Linear Acceleration - Working
- ✅ Status - Working
- ✅ Charge Status - Working
- ✅ Foot Log Available - Working
- ✅ BHI360 Log Available - Working
- ✅ Device Info - Working
- ❌ Foot Log Path - Stub exists, needs GATT implementation
- ❌ BHI360 Log Path - Stub exists, needs GATT implementation
- ❌ Activity Log Available - Not implemented
- ❌ Activity Log Path - Not implemented
- ❌ FOTA Progress - Stub exists, needs GATT implementation

## What Still Needs Implementation

### 1. Add Missing D2D TX Service Characteristics
The following characteristics need to be added to `ble_d2d_tx_service.cpp`:
- Foot Log Path (UUID: 0x76ad68d9)
- BHI360 Log Path (UUID: 0x76ad68db)
- Activity Log Available (UUID: 0x76ad68e1)
- Activity Log Path (UUID: 0x76ad68e2)
- FOTA Progress (UUID: 0x76ad68e3)

### 2. Add Missing D2D RX Service Characteristic
- Delete Activity Log command (UUID: 0xe160ca88)

### 3. Update Control Service
- Add Delete Activity Log command characteristic if not already present

## Current Architecture

```
Phone App
    ↓
Primary Device
    ├── Information Service (data to phone)
    ├── Control Service (commands from phone)
    ├── SMP Proxy Service (FOTA/file access)
    ├── D2D RX Service (receives from secondary)
    └── D2D TX Client (sends to secondary)
         ↓
Secondary Device
    ├── D2D TX Service (sends to primary)
    ├── D2D RX Service (receives from primary)
    └── MCUmgr SMP Service (for FOTA)
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test FOTA Progress**: Update secondary device and verify progress is logged (will show warning about GATT not implemented)
2. **Test Command Cascading**: Use phone to send commands and verify they reach secondary
3. **Test Data Flow**: Verify sensor data flows from secondary → primary → phone
4. **Test SMP Proxy**: Use MCUmgr commands targeting secondary device

## Next Steps

1. Implement the missing GATT characteristics in D2D TX service
2. Add delete activity log command to D2D RX service
3. Test complete end-to-end FOTA progress visibility
4. Verify all file paths are properly transmitted
