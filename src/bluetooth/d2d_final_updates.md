# Final D2D Updates Implementation

## Summary of Completed Work

### âœ… Completed:
1. Added secondary FOTA progress characteristic to Information Service
2. Added FOTA progress characteristic to D2D TX service
3. Added FOTA progress handler to D2D RX client
4. Updated ble_d2d_tx.cpp to use the actual GATT notification function

### ðŸ”§ Still Missing:
1. Delete Activity Log command in Control Service
2. Delete Activity Log handler in D2D RX service
3. Activity log available notifications (foot and BHI360 are done, but not activity)
4. File path characteristics for D2D TX service

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Add Delete Activity Log to Control Service
- Add characteristic UUID
- Add write handler
- Forward to secondary via D2D

### 2. Add Delete Activity Log to D2D RX Service
- Add characteristic UUID
- Add write handler that processes the command

### 3. Add Activity Log Support
- Add activity log available notification support
- Add activity log path notification support

### 4. Add File Path Support to D2D TX Service
- Foot log path characteristic
- BHI360 log path characteristic
- Activity log path characteristic

## Testing the Implementation

1. **FOTA Progress Test**:
   - Update secondary device firmware
   - Monitor primary device logs for "RECEIVED FOTA PROGRESS FROM SECONDARY"
   - Check phone receives updates via Secondary FOTA Progress characteristic

2. **Command Cascading Test**:
   - Send all control commands from phone
   - Verify they reach secondary device

3. **Data Flow Test**:
   - Verify all sensor data flows from secondary â†’ primary â†’ phone
