# D2D Final Implementation Changes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes made to complete the D2D implementation based on the requirements:
1. Separate delete commands for primary and secondary devices
2. Secondary file management visibility for mobile app
3. Complete FOTA progress tracking for both devices

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Information Service (Primary Device)
**File**: `information_service.cpp`

#### Added Secondary File Management Characteristics:
- Secondary Foot Log Available (`0x0c372ebc`)
- Secondary Foot Log Path (`0x0c372ebd`)
- Secondary BHI360 Log Available (`0x0c372ebe`)
- Secondary BHI360 Log Path (`0x0c372ebf`)
- Secondary Activity Log Available (`0x0c372ec0`)
- Secondary Activity Log Path (`0x0c372ec1`)
- Secondary FOTA Progress (`0x0c372ebb`) - Previously added

These allow the mobile app to see file IDs and paths from the secondary device.

### 2. Control Service (Primary Device)
**File**: `control_service.cpp`

#### Separated Delete Commands:
**Primary Device Files** (existing, no cascade):
- Delete Foot Log (`0x4fd5b681`)
- Delete BHI360 Log (`0x4fd5b682`)
- Delete Activity Log (`0x4fd5b687`)

**Secondary Device Files** (new, forward to secondary):
- Delete Secondary Foot Log (`0x4fd5b688`)
- Delete Secondary BHI360 Log (`0x4fd5b689`)
- Delete Secondary Activity Log (`0x4fd5b68a`)

The primary delete commands now only affect primary device storage. The secondary delete commands are forwarded via D2D.

### 3. D2D TX Service (Secondary Device)
**File**: `ble_d2d_tx_service.cpp`

#### Added Path and Activity Log Characteristics:
- Foot Log Path (`0x76ad68d9`)
- BHI360 Log Path (`0x76ad68db`)
- Activity Log Available (`0x76ad68e4`)
- Activity Log Path (`0x76ad68e5`)
- FOTA Progress (`0x76ad68e3`) - Previously added

### 4. D2D RX Service (Secondary Device)
**File**: `ble_d2d_rx.cpp`

#### Added Delete Activity Log Handler:
- Delete Activity Log (`0xe160ca88`)

### 5. D2D RX Client (Primary Device)
**File**: `ble_d2d_rx_client.cpp`

#### Added Handlers for New Characteristics:
- Foot log path handler
- BHI360 log path handler
- Activity log available handler
- Activity log path handler
- FOTA progress handler - Previously added

#### Fixed Compilation Issues:
- Added conditional compilation guards
- Fixed unused parameter warnings
- Added stub implementations for secondary builds

### 6. D2D Data Handler (Primary Device)
**File**: `d2d_data_handler.cpp`

#### Updated to Forward Secondary File Info:
- Routes file paths to appropriate secondary characteristics
- Routes log available notifications to secondary characteristics

### 7. Bluetooth Main Thread
**File**: `bluetooth.cpp`

#### Added Activity Log Support:
- Handles MSG_TYPE_NEW_ACTIVITY_LOG_FILE
- Forwards activity log notifications via D2D

## Mobile App Integration Guide

### File Management
**Primary Device Files**:
- Use standard delete commands (0x4fd5b681, 0x4fd5b682, 0x4fd5b687)
- Monitor standard log available/path characteristics
- Files stored in `/lfs1/`

**Secondary Device Files**:
- Use secondary delete commands (0x4fd5b688, 0x4fd5b689, 0x4fd5b68a)
- Monitor secondary log available/path characteristics
- Files accessed via File Proxy with `/lfs2/` prefix

### FOTA Progress Monitoring
- Primary FOTA Progress: Standard characteristic
- Secondary FOTA Progress: New characteristic (`0x0c372ebb`)
- Both update independently during firmware updates

### Best Practices
1. Always check file ownership before deletion
2. Use correct delete command for each device
3. Monitor both sets of file characteristics
4. Handle both FOTA progress characteristics

## Testing Checklist

### File Management
- [ ] Primary files can be deleted without affecting secondary
- [ ] Secondary files can be deleted via new commands
- [ ] File paths are correctly reported for both devices
- [ ] Activity logs work for both devices

### FOTA Updates
- [ ] Primary FOTA progress visible on standard characteristic
- [ ] Secondary FOTA progress visible on new characteristic
- [ ] Both devices can update independently

### Command Routing
- [ ] Primary delete commands don't cascade
- [ ] Secondary delete commands are forwarded correctly
- [ ] All file types (foot, BHI360, activity) work

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Clear Separation**: Mobile app knows exactly which device owns each file
2. **Independent Control**: Can manage files on each device separately
3. **Full Visibility**: All file IDs and paths visible for both devices
4. **Proper FOTA Tracking**: Independent progress for each device
5. **Scalable Design**: Easy to add more file types or devices
