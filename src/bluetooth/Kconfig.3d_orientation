# 3D Orientation Service Configuration

config HIGH_RATE_3D_ORIENTATION
    bool "Enable high-rate 3D orientation updates"
    default n
    help
      Enable higher sampling and transmission rates for 3D orientation visualization.
      When enabled:
      - BHI360 quaternion sampling: 100Hz (instead of 50Hz)
      - BLE transmission rate: 50Hz (instead of 20Hz)
      - D2D transmission rate: 50Hz (instead of 20Hz)
      
      This provides smoother 3D visualization but increases power consumption
      and BLE bandwidth usage.

config 3D_ORIENTATION_BHI360_RATE
    int "BHI360 quaternion sampling rate (Hz)"
    default 100 if HIGH_RATE_3D_ORIENTATION
    default 50
    range 10 400
    help
      The rate at which the BHI360 outputs quaternion data.
      Higher rates provide smoother motion but increase power consumption.
      The BHI360 can support up to 400Hz for virtual sensors.

config 3D_ORIENTATION_BLE_RATE
    int "BLE transmission rate (Hz)"
    default 50 if HIGH_RATE_3D_ORIENTATION
    default 20
    range 1 50
    help
      The rate at which quaternion data is sent over BLE.
      Limited by BLE connection interval and bandwidth.
      Higher rates provide smoother visualization but may cause packet loss.
