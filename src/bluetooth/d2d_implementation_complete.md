# D2D Implementation Complete Summary

## ✅ All Implementations Completed

### 1. Secondary FOTA Progress to Phone
- **Information Service**: Added `secondary_fota_progress_uuid` (0x0c372ebb)
- **Characteristic**: Read + Notify for secondary FOTA progress
- **Function**: `jis_secondary_fota_progress_notify()` - Primary only
- **Flow**: Secondary → D2D → Primary → Phone

### 2. D2D FOTA Progress Transmission
- **D2D TX Service**: Added `d2d_fota_progress_uuid` (0x76ad68e3)
- **Function**: `d2d_tx_notify_fota_progress()` 
- **D2D RX Client**: Added handler `fota_progress_notify_handler()`
- **Integration**: Secondary's FOTA callbacks now send progress via D2D

### 3. Delete Activity Log Command
- **Control Service**: Added `delete_activity_log_command_uuid` (0x4fd5b687)
- **D2D TX**: Added `ble_d2d_tx_send_delete_activity_log_command()`
- **D2D RX Service**: Added `d2d_delete_activity_log_command_uuid` (0xe160ca88)
- **Flow**: Phone → Primary → Secondary

## Complete Command Cascading (Phone → Primary → Secondary)

1. ✅ Set Time
2. ✅ Delete Foot Log  
3. ✅ Delete BHI360 Log
4. ✅ Delete Activity Log (NEW!)
5. ✅ Start Activity
6. ✅ Stop Activity
7. ✅ Trigger BHI360 Calibration

## Complete Data Flow (Secondary → Primary → Phone)

1. ✅ Foot Sensor Data
2. ✅ BHI360 3D Mapping Data
3. ✅ BHI360 Step Count
4. ✅ BHI360 Linear Acceleration
5. ✅ Status
6. ✅ Charge Status
7. ✅ Foot Log Available
8. ✅ BHI360 Log Available
9. ✅ Device Info
10. ✅ FOTA Progress (NEW!)

## Still TODO (Optional Enhancements)

### File Path Characteristics for D2D TX Service
These are currently stubbed but not implemented in GATT:
- Foot log path (UUID: 0x76ad68d9)
- BHI360 log path (UUID: 0x76ad68db)
- Activity log available (UUID: 0x76ad68e1)
- Activity log path (UUID: 0x76ad68e2)

These would require:
1. Adding characteristics to D2D TX service
2. Adding handlers to D2D RX client
3. Forwarding paths from secondary to primary

## Testing Checklist

### FOTA Progress Test
- [ ] Start secondary device FOTA update via SMP Proxy
- [ ] Monitor primary logs for "RECEIVED FOTA PROGRESS FROM SECONDARY"
- [ ] Verify phone receives updates on Secondary FOTA Progress characteristic
- [ ] Check progress percentages match actual update progress

### Delete Activity Log Test
- [ ] Send delete activity log command from phone (ID: 1-255)
- [ ] Verify primary logs: "Sent delete activity log message"
- [ ] Verify secondary logs: "D2D RX: Delete Activity Log Command"
- [ ] Check activity log file is deleted from secondary filesystem

### Complete System Test
- [ ] All 7 control commands work from phone to secondary
- [ ] All 10 data types flow from secondary to phone
- [ ] FOTA updates work for both devices with progress visibility
- [ ] File management works for all log types
