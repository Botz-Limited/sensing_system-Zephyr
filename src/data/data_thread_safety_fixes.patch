--- Thread Safety Fixes for data.cpp ---

1. RACE CONDITION: logging_foot_active and logging_bhi360_active
   These are accessed from multiple threads without protection.
   
2. MUTEX ISSUE: Missing unlock in error path in start_foot_sensor_logging
   If fs_mkdir fails, mutex is not unlocked.

3. SEQUENCE NUMBER RACE: get_next_file_sequence called without protection
   Multiple threads could get same sequence number.

--- FIXES TO APPLY ---

1. Add atomic operations for logging flags
2. Fix mutex unlock in all error paths
3. Protect sequence number generation
